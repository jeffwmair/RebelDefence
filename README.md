# Rebel Defence
I made this game for a Computer Graphics course in University.  At the time I had it working in Windows and OSX, but at the moment the Visual Studio project seems to be broken (and I don't have the interest in fixing for now).  So, for now I can only verify that it works in Mac OSX.  There are two ways to run it:

1. Command-line make
1. XCode

## Command-line make

```shell
# switch into the src dir of the program
$ cd rebel_defence/src
# just type make to run the build
$ make
# after building, run rebeldefence
$ ./rebeldefence
```

## XCode

Running in XCode should be more or less self-explanatory.  Open the Xcode project, build, run.
