# Rebel Defence
I made this game for a Computer Graphics course in University.  At the time I had it working in Windows and OSX, but at the moment the Visual Studio project seems to be broken (and I don't have the interest in fixing for now).  So, for now I can only verify that it works in Mac OSX.  There are two ways to run it:

1. Command-line make
1. XCode

NOTE: I am not maintaining or extending this project any further.

## Command-line make

The following should work if you have make and g++ installed:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jeffwmair/rebel_defence.git
cd rebel_defence/src
make
./rebeldefence
```

## XCode

Running in XCode should be more or less self-explanatory.  Open the Xcode project, build, run.
